<ol>
  <li>Why is visulation effective?
    <ul>
      <li>Visulation is effective because it helps create a greater appeal and interest in interacting with data and learning new things in a way that can create new persceptions depending on the way the data is presented in.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </li>

  <li>What are the more effective ways to encode data for perceptual tasks?
    <ul>
      <li>One of the most effective ways to encode data for perceptual tasks is to map the data into visual properties. Also by thinking of the task you want to enable and trying different graphic forms and testing them you can achieve the most effective visualization.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What are trade-offs that Cairo asks us to consider when building a visualization?
    <ul>
      <li>One of the trade-offs Cario asks us to consider when building a visualization is that the way you present the data visually can have real consquences on the lives of people who read your visualizations so be careful on how you present your data.</li>
